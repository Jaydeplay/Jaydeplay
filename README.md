Hello There, I'm Jaydeplay,
As you can see from the existence on this account on the site, I like programming and playing games. (Puzzle games good)
I have learned Lua for Roblox, done some Scratch coding, and am currently learning C# for Unity.

Now stop looking at my README file, go do something else...
